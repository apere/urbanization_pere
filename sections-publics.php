				Recent claims around big data and smart cities suggest that we are on the verge of an unprecedented and overwhelming wave of information about the contemporary city. While technological change may produce more information, the status of that information relative to decision-making has been a longstanding area of research in the design disciplines. The discourse and practices associated with design thinking and design research describe the role of design in dealing with the surplus of data in relation to a surfeit of attention. This line of research proposes to examine contemporary understandings in the cognitive and behavioral sciences in relation to decision-making as informed by design thinking. 
				convened by Charles Waldheim, Helen Kongsgaard, Robert Pietrusko, and Andrew Witt
