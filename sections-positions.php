				The work of the office can be described under the general rubric of design research. Design research is synthetic, incorporating information relative to a particular project from a diverse array of sources. Often characterized by its capacity to organize and visually represent complex arrays of information, design research deploys simulations and scenario-based projections to reveal latent potentials for future conditions. Design research is most often propositional, rather than simply empirical or descriptive. Design research projects stand simultaneously as propositions for intervention in the world, and as a form of knowledge about the world.

				Five specific themes articulate the Office’s current commitments. In certain respects these themes represent a return to many of the central preoccupations of modern planning, from the perspective of contemporary conditions for urbanization. This is a timely agenda, as the ‘semantic turn’ away from the challenges of modernization has left the urban arts bereft of models and motivations for addressing the contemporary conditions for urbanization.
			</p>

				<strong>New Towns and Satellite Cities</strong>&mdash;Based in part on the received failures of modern planning on the one hand, and the failures of neoliberal political economy on the other, the urban arts have receded from the articulation of novel or innovative models for urban form. In spite of this abdication, urbanization continues apace, as the design disciplines seem to lack the capacity to articulate alternative and better models for new urban districts. This research examines the conditions, contexts, and cultural status of new settlements, satellite cities, and new towns.

				<strong>Relational Urban Models</strong>&mdash;Recent discourse in the design disciplines has renewed the modernist ambition for urban order while embracing the complexity and indeterminacy of urbanization. This shift away from the totalizing approach of modernism and toward the relational design strategies associated with ‘ecological urbanism’ requires a new set of design tools, specifically relational models, to describe, analyze, and propose urban form in relation to ecological and social function. This research advances digital models to integrate measures such as solar orientation and performance into the evaluative process of design.

				<strong>Mobility and the Shape of the City</strong>&mdash;Contemporary urbanization is characterized by various modes of mobility of subject, object, and information. The relationship between transportation and communication networks was a central element of various projects of modern planning; the urban arts have more recently retreated into the traditional forms of the city as a refuge of sorts from the speed and scale of contemporary modes of mobility. This line of inquiry is concerned with the transition to renewable energy sources for transport and the potential for this transition to impact the formal conditions for the contemporary urban project.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Adaptation to Climate Change</strong>&mdash;The emergent topic of urban adaptation to the effects of anthropogenic climate change is among the more pressing areas of research on the contemporary city. While it was not initially clear how the mitigation of climate change implicated the disciplines of architecture, urban design, or planning, the more recent focus on adaptation to ongoing effects of anthropogenic climate change puts those fields at the center of the conversation. The global scale and rapid onset of the challenges associated with sea level rise and increased storm events recommend a more generalizable research agenda on the response of cities to these conditions.  At the same time, design strategies for urban adaptation must be calibrated to the specific conditions of particular regions and their associated ecologies, economies, infrastructures, and identities. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Data, Design, and Decision</strong>&mdash;Recent claims around big data and smart cities suggest that we are on the verge of an unprecedented and overwhelming wave of information about the contemporary city. While technological change may produce more information, the status of that information relative to decision-making has been a longstanding area of research in the design disciplines. The discourse and practices associated with design thinking and design research describe the role of design in dealing with the surplus of data in relation to a surfeit of attention. This line of research proposes to examine contemporary understandings in the cognitive and behavioral sciences in relation to decision-making as informed by design thinking.</p>
